sub-process API
===============

The sub-process API makes it possible to run background sub-processes
that should run until the git command exits and communicate with it
through stdin and stdout.

The sub-processes are kept in a hashmap.

This API is based on the run-command API.

Functions
---------

`subprocess_start`::

	Start a subprocess and add it to the subprocess hashmap.

`subprocess_stop`::

	Kill a subprocess and remove it from the subprocess hashmap.

`subprocess_find_entry`::

	Find a subprocess in the subprocess hashmap.

`subprocess_get_child_process`::

	Get the underlying `struct child_process` from a subprocess.

`subprocess_read_status`::

	Read packets until "status=<foo>" key/value pairs are found.

Data structures
---------------

* `struct subprocess_entry`

This describes the command launched by the subprocess, the
`struct child_process` for the subprocess and its hashmap entry.
